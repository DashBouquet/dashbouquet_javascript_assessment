Write a function that takes an arbitrary number, reorders the digits in reverse and add it to the original number until you get a number where all the digits are equal.

For example:

The *value* passed is `254`.

Let's go!

```
254 + 452 = 706

706 + 607 = 1313

1313 + 3131 = 4444 (bingo!)
```

EXPECTED OUTPUT

Message like "3 iterations for 4444".

This task is based on the great math mystery - The 196 Problem.
